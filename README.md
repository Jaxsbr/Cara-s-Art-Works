# Cara-s-Art-Works

My daughter Cara is an artist and draws, paints and crafts things all the time. Eventually these things stack up somewhere in the house and requires us to throw some of it away. This breaks my heart as I love seeing how she improves and wish I could keep all of it.

My idea is the take photos of her “croations” as she calls it and store it online where it’s easy to view. This way I can discard the physical creations and still keep a log of her works.
